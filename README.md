JSON data structure navigator
-----------------------------

Credit for this tool goes to [Denis Isidoro](https://github.com/denisidoro), who
has further type extensions in the original repository.

Note: The demo calls `dot js nav` which is the usage in the repo this is forked from. Instead call `nav` directly.
